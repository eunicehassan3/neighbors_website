            <span class="arrow">▶</span>
        </div>

        <div class="schedule-details">
            <p>This presentation examines how neighborhood design subtly influences the way we connect—or fail to connect—with the people living next door. From white picket fences and front porches in postwar suburbia to gated communities and apartment intercom systems, architecture has always played a silent but powerful role in shaping neighborly behavior. Drawing from urban planning, architectural history, and cultural studies, this session explores how the built environment reflects broader social values like privacy, inclusion, and community—and how it may need to evolve to foster connection in a more isolated world.</p>

            <span class="arrow">▶</span>
        </div>

        <div class="schedule-details">
            <p>What does it mean to be a neighbor in a world of entrenched inequality? This talk delves into the complicated dynamics of race and class in American neighborhoods, tracing how historical forces like redlining, blockbusting, and gentrification have shaped the ways people interact across property lines. Through a mix of historical analysis, media representations, and contemporary case studies, the presentation challenges idealized visions of neighborliness and explores how neighborly relationships can serve both as a site of tension and a foundation for grassroots solidarity and resistance.</p>

            <h3>10:00AM - 10:50AM: Global Neighbors: Hospitality and Ethics in a Connected World</h3>
            <span class="arrow">▶</span>
        </div>

        <div class="schedule-details">
            <p>In a time of increasing global displacement, climate migration, and refugee crises, the idea of “neighbor” stretches far beyond the picket fence. This session explores the ethical implications of being a neighbor in a global society. Drawing on philosophical concepts of hospitality from thinkers like Emmanuel Levinas and traditions rooted in Christianity, Islam, and indigenous worldviews, the presentation asks: What responsibilities do we have to those who are not proximate, but still dependent on our choices? How can we redefine the idea of neighbor to extend beyond borders, nation-states, and comfort zones?</p>

        </div>

        <div class="schedule-details">
          <p>While often seen as gentle and nostalgic, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood was, in many ways, a revolutionary vision of community care. This presentation takes a deep dive into the cultural and ethical significance of Fred Rogers’ philosophy of unconditional kindness, emotional literacy, and social responsibility. By analyzing key episodes and public speeches, the talk reveals how Mr. Rogers challenged societal norms on race, disability, grief, and mental health, modeling a neighborliness that was not only kind but courageous. In a world increasingly marked by polarization, Rogers’ legacy offers a blueprint for a more compassionate civic life.</p>

            <p>Apps like Nextdoor, Facebook Neighborhoods, and local Reddit threads are changing how we talk to—and about—our neighbors. This presentation investigates how digital platforms shape modern perceptions of community, safety, and belonging, often amplifying both connection and division. With examples ranging from neighborhood watch posts to viral local memes, the talk critically examines how technology mediates modern neighborly behavior. Drawing on communication theory, tech ethics, and user behavior research, it asks: Are we more connected than ever, or just louder at a distance?</p>
