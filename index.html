        <h1>WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR?</h1>
        <div class="text-img">
          <p>
            If we believe with John Donne that “no man is an island” then it follows rather naturally that we ask ourselves serious questions about our relationships with other people: Who is our neighbor? What constitutes neighborliness? What responsibility do I have to care for my neighbor? Where is the boundary between myself and my neighbor—and who determines this dividing line? Is the separation between self and neighbor even healthy—do “good fences make good neighbors” as the neighbor in Robert Frost’s 1914 poem “Mending Wall” suggests?</p>

        <h1>ABOUT THE HUMANITIES SYMPOSIUM</h1>
        <p>
            A humanities symposium is a week-long event, often organized by a university's humanities department, that features interdisciplinary talks, panel discussions, and other activities focused on a specific theme related to the human experience.
            Past symposia have focused on subjects ranging from fairy tales to food, time to technology, Benjamin Franklin to the lunar landing, democracy to otherness, travel to home. In addition to presentations by featured speakers from across the country - including writers, philosophers, social reformers and academics from a wide range of disciplines - presentations and panels by Belmont faculty and students have consistently provided most of the events, involving participants from across the campus. Most events are offered for WELLCore credit. Additional activities coordinated in conjunction with the symposia in years past have included an international film festival, art exhibits, an astronomical viewing, service projects and field trips to local and regional museums. Recordings can be accessed through the Belmont Library Open Commons at the Belmont Digital Repository.
